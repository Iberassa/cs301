/*
5) A Function Expression is created when the execution reaches it and is usable only from that moment.
 while A Function Declaration can be called earlier than it is defined. Therefore it is nice to use function declaration 
 because it is clear and flexable. 
 
 
 6) yes we can use, declare, copy any place of a code.
 
 example:- if (expression === "add") {
        (function () {console.log('Immediately invoked function execution');
    })()
        } else
            return "The expression entered is not right."
