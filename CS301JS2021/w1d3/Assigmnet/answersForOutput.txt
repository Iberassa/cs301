1) What happens when you forget a break while using switch statement?
 Ans:-  When we dont use break while using switch if the case statment is 
        true then after excuting the command inside that case statement the 
        program will continue excuting the next command instead of breaking 
        out exiting.

  The outputs are 0 and 1.

3)
  yes it will change becuase foo becomes a string and the case statements are in number format.
  Therefore the output will be:-  default
